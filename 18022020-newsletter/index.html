            <h1>India’s tallest and biggest aviary opens in Mumbai</h1>
            <p>
              Mumbai is now home to country’s tallest and biggest aviary. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray
              inaugurated the aviary, as part of the Republic Day on Jan 26, 2020. This is the country's first
              ‘walk-through’ aviary that has been built at the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and Zoo at Byculla in
              Mumbai. This new attraction is spread across an area of 18200 sq ft and is 44 ft tall, which means that
              the aviary is as high as a five-storeyed building. Latest reports suggest that the aviary will house more
              than 100 species of exotic, rare, and common birds, living in their natural environs.

            <p>
              Mumbai is all set to become a City that Never Sleeps in the real sense. This means feeling hungry at odd

              the Maharashtra Government has formally approved the proposal of allowing eateries and shops to remain
              open 24X7. Reportedly, multiplexes, restaurants, malls, and shops will now be able to stay open
